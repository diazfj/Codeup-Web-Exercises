		<p>'Twas <em>brillig</em>, and the slithy toves<br>
		Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
		All <em>mimsy</em> were the borogoves,<br>
		And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
	
	
		<p id="quotes">"<strong>Beware the Jabberwock</strong>, my son!<br>
		The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
		Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
		The frumious Bandersnatch!"</p>


		<p>He took the vorpal sword in hand;<br>
		Long time the manxome foe he sought-<br>
		So he rested he by the Tumtum tree<br>
		And stood awhile in thought.</p>
